# Introduction to Programming

This repo contains sample program code from the *Introduction to Programming* module. It is for the 2024/2025 academic year, second semester.

It probably makes little sense without access to the corresponding sections on MyBeckett.

The code here is provided with **absolutely no warranty**.

## Requirements

The code here is (mostly) developed with Python 3.12. It should also work with any recent version of Python 3, say 3.10 or later. This could be configured either as a local interpreter, or in a virtual environment.

Any other packages used will be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
